# no-clue-zone 🚧🌀

Welcome to the **no-clue-zone** — a digital junk drawer for all the random stuff I tinker with.

## 🧠 What is this?

This is where I throw in:
- Spontaneous ideas 💡  
- Code snippets 💻  
- Failed experiments 💥  
- Notes, thoughts, and mini projects 🗒️  
- Whatever else I don't know what to do with 😅

## 📎 Why?

Because not everything needs a plan.  
Sometimes, I just code to see what happens — this is that place.

## ⚠️ Warning

Things here may be broken, unfinished, or make no sense. Proceed with curiosity.

# Digital Junk Drawer 🧠💾

A digital junk drawer for all my random experiments, ideas, snippets, notes, and whatever else I feel like tossing in.  
No rules — just bits and bytes.

## 📎 What’s Inside?

- Code experiments  
- Half-baked ideas  
- Debug trials  
- Quick notes  
- Creative sparks  
- Useful (or not so useful) stuff

## 🎯 Purpose

Not everything needs to be polished or finished.  
This repo is my free space to explore, break, learn, and create without boundaries.

## 🚧 Disclaimer

Things might be messy, buggy, or just plain weird — and that’s the point.
